It is said, <a href='#noteLit0' class='ref'> all-inclusively  it’s called ‘consciousness’ (<i>citta</i>) because it thinks (<i>cinteti</i>);</a> or else <a href='#noteLit1' class='ref'>it is called consciousness as that which accumulates (<i>cinoti</i>) the continuum of one-self.</a> [2]",
    "9. It’s called ‘consciousness’ (<i>citta</i>) due to its making things variegated (<i>vicitta/vicitra</i>), or due to its own being variegated (<i>cittatā/citratā</i>). [It can mean] mind as concept , cognition (<i>viññāṇa</i>), variegated (<i>vicitta</i>), and painting-work (<i>cittakammaka</i>) . Here it should be understood by a wise person in the sense of cognition.",
    "It is of one kind as to having an object; it is of two kinds with regard to producing and not producing results. Herein, wholesome and unwholesome are productive of results; indeterminate ones are not productive of results. According to its classification as wholesome, unwholesome, or indeterminate, it is of three kinds. What is the meaning of this ‘wholesome’ (<i>kusala</i>) here?",
    "10. It’s called ‘wholesome’ because of its shaking (<i>salana</i>) contemptible (<i>kucchita</i>), or cutting (<i>lavana</i>) of blades of kusa grass (<i>kusa</i>) , or else because it is something that by knowledge (<i>kusa</i>)  should be acquired (<i>lātabba</i>).",
    "11. The word ‘wholesome’ is seen in the meanings: clever, health, faultless, and giving agreeable results. Herein, [it means] ‘blameless’, and ‘giving agreeable results’.",
    "Therefore, the characteristic of the wholesome is faultlessness, and [ability to] produce agreeable results; its function is destruction of unwholesome;  its manifestation is purification. Or, its characteristic is faultlessness because it opposes the faulty; its function is [bringing about] the state of purity; its manifestation is production of agreeable results, and its proximate cause is proper attention. The characteristic of the unwholesome is faultiness and production of undesirable results; the indeterminate has its characteristic being opposite of these two or not productive of results.",
    "Herein, the wholesome consciousness is of twenty-one kind. It is of four kinds with regard to the plane: of sphere-of-sense-desires, of fine-material-sphere, of immaterial-sphere, and supramundane.",
